## ‚öôÔ∏è 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Explanation of Each Component

---

### üî∏ **Spring Cloud Gateway (Routing Layer)**

**What:**
Spring Cloud Gateway handles all incoming client requests and routes them to backend services based on route definitions.

**Why:**
Instead of each client talking directly to multiple microservices, the gateway acts as a single entry point (simplifies architecture, security, and monitoring).

**How (Example route):**

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: product-service
          uri: lb://PRODUCT-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/api/products/**
```

* `lb://` ‚Üí uses **Spring LoadBalancer** for service discovery.
* `Path=/api/products/**` ‚Üí any URL starting with `/api/products/` is forwarded.

**Interview Tip üí°:**

> "Spring Cloud Gateway works on a filter chain model ‚Äî pre-filters, route filters, and post-filters. It replaces Zuul in modern Spring Cloud setups for reactive and high-performance routing."

---

### üî∏ **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer**

**What:**
A lightweight client-side load balancer that distributes requests among service instances discovered via Eureka.

**Why:**
To ensure no single instance is overloaded.

**How:**
The Gateway calls `lb://SERVICE-NAME` ‚Äî LoadBalancer internally fetches available instances from Eureka and distributes load round-robin (or custom strategy).

**Interview Tip üí°:**

> ‚ÄúSpring Cloud LoadBalancer is preferred over Netflix Ribbon, which is now deprecated.‚Äù

---

### üî∏ **Eureka Client (Service Discovery)**

**What:**
Each microservice registers itself to Eureka Server.
Gateway queries Eureka to find instances dynamically.

**Why:**
Avoids hardcoding URLs; supports scaling.

**Example:**

```yaml
eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```

**Interview Trap Q:**

> ‚ùì If Eureka is down, how will gateway route requests?
> **Answer:** Gateway will use the last known cache of service instances (Eureka client keeps them locally until next sync).

---

### üî∏ **Spring Security (Centralized Auth)**

**What:**
Authenticates and authorizes requests centrally at the gateway instead of each microservice.

**Why:**
To simplify microservice security and reduce redundancy.

**How:**
You typically add a pre-filter that extracts JWT tokens from headers and validates them before forwarding.

**Benefit:**
‚Üí Each backend service can assume requests are already authenticated.

**Interview Tip üí°:**

> ‚ÄúCentralized authentication through Gateway enforces consistent security and reduces attack surface.‚Äù

---

### üî∏ **Redis Caching (Performance Layer)**

**What:**
Stores frequently accessed responses in memory.

**Why:**
Reduces repeated backend calls and improves response time.

**How:**
Defined in `CacheConfig.java`:

```java
@Bean
public RedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer redisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer() {
    return builder -> builder
        .withCacheConfiguration("productCache",
            RedisCacheConfiguration.defaultCacheConfig()
                .entryTtl(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
                .disableCachingNullValues());
}
```

* `entryTtl(5 min)` ‚Üí auto expiry
* `disableCachingNullValues()` ‚Üí prevents caching null data

**Interview Trap Q:**

> ‚ùì What happens when the cache is full?
> **Answer:** Redis uses LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction if `maxmemory-policy` is configured.

---

### üî∏ **Custom KeyGenerator**

**What:**
Generates a unique key for each cached request.

**How:**

```java
String path = exchange.getRequest().getURI().getPath();
String headers = exchange.getRequest().getHeaders().toString().replaceAll("Authorization.*?,", "");
return path + "_" + headers.hashCode();
```

**Interview Tip üí°:**

> ‚ÄúWe remove the Authorization header to avoid generating different cache keys for the same data when different tokens are used.‚Äù

---

### üî∏ **CacheInvalidationFilter**

**What:**
Removes stale data from cache when write operations (POST) occur.

**Why:**
To prevent serving outdated responses after data modification.

**How:**

```java
if (exchange.getRequest().getMethod() == HttpMethod.POST) {
    String path = exchange.getRequest().getURI().getPath();
    redisTemplate.delete(path.replace("/api/", ""));
}
```

**Interview Tip üí°:**

> ‚ÄúCache invalidation ensures eventual consistency between cache and database.‚Äù

---

### üî∏ **Monitoring ‚Äî Actuator & Prometheus**

**What:**
Collects runtime metrics for observability.

**How:**

* Actuator exposes `/actuator/prometheus`.
* Prometheus scrapes this endpoint for metrics like request count, response time, cache hit/miss.

**Example:**

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info,prometheus
```

**Interview Tip üí°:**

> ‚ÄúPrometheus integrates with Grafana dashboards for visualizing gateway and microservice health.‚Äù

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5Ô∏è‚É£ Flow of Request (Step-by-Step)

1. **Client ‚Üí API Gateway**
   Request hits the Gateway.
2. **Security Filter**
   Auth token verified (if enabled).
3. **Cache Lookup**
   Redis cache checked using generated key.
4. **If Cache Hit:**
   Response returned directly.
5. **If Cache Miss:**
   Gateway forwards request via **LoadBalancer** to a healthy instance (from Eureka).
6. **Backend Service** processes and returns response.
7. **Gateway stores response** in Redis (5 min TTL).
8. **If POST/PUT request:**
   `CacheInvalidationFilter` deletes relevant cache keys.
9. **Prometheus** records metrics for performance tracking.

# üìù API Gateway & Load Balancer Microservice ‚Äî Interview Q&A Playbook

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is an API Gateway and why do we use it?**

**Answer:**
An API Gateway is a **single entry point for all client requests** to a microservices architecture. It routes requests to the appropriate microservice, handles **cross-cutting concerns** like authentication, authorization, logging, rate-limiting, and caching.

**Why:**

* Centralized routing reduces complexity for clients.
* Improves **security** by authenticating requests at a single layer.
* Enables **load balancing** between service instances.
* Provides a **place for caching and monitoring**, reducing backend load.

**Example in our project:**
Spring Cloud Gateway routes `/api/products/**` to `productservice` dynamically using Eureka and LoadBalancer.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ How does Spring Cloud Gateway differ from Zuul?**

**Answer:**

* **Zuul 1** is **blocking** (servlet-based); Spring Cloud Gateway is **reactive (non-blocking)**.
* Spring Cloud Gateway supports **modern filters**, **route predicates**, and is more **performant** for high throughput.
* Supports **Spring Boot 3+** and reactive programming.

**Project usage:**
Our gateway uses **GatewayFilterChain** and **GlobalFilter** to implement caching and cache invalidation efficiently in a non-blocking manner.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ How does Load Balancing work in your setup?**

**Answer:**

* We use **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer**.
* Requests to `lb://PRODUCT-SERVICE` are dynamically routed to an available instance from **Eureka**.
* LoadBalancer selects an instance using **round-robin** by default.

**Benefit:**

* If one instance fails, LoadBalancer automatically routes to another instance.
* Avoids overloading a single service.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ What is Eureka and why is it needed?**

**Answer:**
Eureka is a **service discovery server**:

* Services register themselves with Eureka on startup.
* API Gateway queries Eureka to get **live instances** of services.

**Why:**

* Eliminates **hardcoding of service URLs**.
* Supports **dynamic scaling**, i.e., adding/removing instances without changing gateway config.

**Example:**

```yaml
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you secure your microservices?**

**Answer:**

* Spring Security is enabled in the Gateway.
* **Authentication & authorization** happen centrally at the gateway.
* Backend services trust the gateway (they assume incoming requests are authenticated).
* Supports JWT, API keys, or OAuth2 tokens.

**Benefit:**

* Simplifies microservices by removing security logic from each service.
* Reduces attack surface.

**Interview Trap:**

> What if the gateway is compromised?

* Then all services could be accessed improperly ‚Äî hence always secure gateway endpoints, rotate secrets, and use HTTPS.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ How is caching implemented?**

**Answer:**

* We use **Redis** for caching frequent responses.
* `CacheConfig.java` defines a cache `productCache` with **TTL = 5 minutes**.
* Null values are not cached to prevent storing invalid data.

**Key generation:**

* Cache key = `request path + hash of headers (excluding Authorization)`
* Ensures unique keys per request but avoids multiple entries for same data due to token differences.

**Benefit:**

* Reduces load on backend services.
* Improves response time for frequent requests.

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle cache invalidation?**

**Answer:**

* Implemented **CacheInvalidationFilter.java**.
* If a **POST request** occurs (data modification), relevant cache entries are deleted.
* Ensures **stale data is not served**.

**Example:**

```java
if (exchange.getRequest().getMethod() == HttpMethod.POST) {
    redisTemplate.delete(path.replace("/api/", ""));
}
```

**Interview Trap:**

> What if DELETE or PUT modifies data?

* Extend filter to handle **PUT and DELETE methods** similarly.

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ How does monitoring work in your system?**

**Answer:**

* Spring Boot Actuator exposes metrics and health endpoints.
* Prometheus scrapes `/actuator/prometheus` for request counts, latencies, cache hits, and other custom metrics.
* Enables dashboards in Grafana for **real-time observability**.

**Benefits:**

* Detect slow requests.
* Monitor cache performance.
* Track rate-limiting and request patterns.

---

## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Explain request flow step-by-step**

1. **Client sends request** ‚Üí hits API Gateway.
2. **Gateway applies security filters** ‚Üí validates JWT/token.
3. **Cache lookup** ‚Üí if response exists in Redis, return immediately.
4. **LoadBalancer routes request** ‚Üí if cache miss, forward to live microservice instance.
5. **Microservice processes request** ‚Üí returns response to Gateway.
6. **Cache store** ‚Üí gateway stores response in Redis (5-min TTL).
7. **POST/PUT** ‚Üí CacheInvalidationFilter deletes related cache entries.
8. **Monitoring** ‚Üí Prometheus collects metrics for every request.

---

## **üîü What design patterns are used?**

| Pattern       | Usage                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Proxy**     | Gateway routes requests to services.                               |
| **Strategy**  | LoadBalancer can have multiple strategies (round-robin, weighted). |
| **Builder**   | RedisCacheManager configuration.                                   |
| **Decorator** | Filter chaining in Gateway.                                        |
| **Singleton** | Spring Beans (CacheConfig, RedisTemplate).                         |

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ SOLID Principles**

| Principle | Example                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SRP**   | `CacheConfig` only configures cache. `CacheInvalidationFilter` only clears cache. |
| **OCP**   | Add new filters without modifying existing code.                                  |
| **LSP**   | GlobalFilter implementations can be replaced.                                     |
| **ISP**   | No unnecessary interfaces; each filter has minimal responsibility.                |
| **DIP**   | Dependencies injected (RedisTemplate) instead of creating internally.             |

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Redis Details You Should Know**

* **Key-value store**: fast in-memory caching.
* **TTL**: prevents stale data.
* **Eviction policies**: LRU, LFU, volatile-lru.
* **Data types supported**: Strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets.
* **Spring Boot Integration**: `spring-boot-starter-data-redis`.

**Interview Tip:**

> Redis is ideal for frequently-read but rarely-updated data, like product catalog details.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Rate Limiting**

* Implemented using **RequestRateLimiter filter**.
* Configured per route:

```yaml
replenishRate: 10
burstCapacity: 20
key-resolver: ipKeyResolver
```

* Limits each IP to **10 requests/sec** with burst allowance of 20.
* Protects backend services from overload or DDoS attacks.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Common Trap Questions**

1. **What happens if Redis fails?**

    * Gateway falls back to fetching from microservice. TTL cache improves performance but is **optional**; system remains functional.

2. **What happens if Eureka is down?**

    * LoadBalancer uses **cached instances** until Eureka recovers.
    * New instances cannot register until Eureka comes back.

3. **How to handle caching for dynamic queries?**

    * Include query params in cache key or **avoid caching highly dynamic responses**.

4. **How to scale Gateway?**

    * Deploy multiple Gateway instances behind a load balancer (Nginx/ALB).
    * Ensure Redis and Eureka are **clustered for HA**.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Summary ‚Äî Interview Talking Points**

* **Gateway acts as central entry point** for microservices.
* **Eureka + LoadBalancer** allows dynamic discovery & scaling.
* **Redis caching + invalidation** improves performance and data freshness.
* **Spring Security** centralizes authentication/authorization.
* **Prometheus + Actuator** provides observability.
* **Filters & design patterns** make the system modular and maintainable.
* **SOLID principles followed** in each component.
